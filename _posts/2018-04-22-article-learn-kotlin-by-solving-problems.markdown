Kotlin is marketed as a statically typed programming language for modern multiplatform applications.

This means it is a type-safe language with a lot of modern language constructs and can target multiple platforms (Mobile, Web, Desktop).

Last year, Google announced it as an official language on android. Since then, it has been growing popular among developer especially android developers. Official Kotlin Apis are also supported on some server-side project like Spring, Vaadin etc.

I have started a YouTube playlist that focuses on introducing Kotlin to developers (especially Java developers) based on a CoderAfrica fork of the official Kotlin Koans.

If you are interested in the Video Playlist, you can check out the videos here.

I am currently taking a course on video editing and production. The production will get better with time.

After the course, i hope to create a multiplatform project in Kotlin here. It will include a Kotlin server project, a kotlin web application, kotlin android app and a kotlin IOS app with Kotlin Native. 

It will be fun to build and blog about the entire journey here.
