Hi,

Welcome to the CoderAfrica Blog.

This has been on my mind for sometime now. I just never had the will to start.

I will blog about Programming here. I will talk about technologies I love and some that i use everyday at work.

I plan to do interesting projects here and explain them as i do them.

Every code i use on this blog will be part of a project that will be on CoderAfricaâ€™s Github Page.

Sometimes i may record videos and they will all be publish on CoderAfrica Youtube Channel.

Overall, I hope this project will be fun and useful to some people.

Thank you for reading and welcome to CoderAfrica Blog.
